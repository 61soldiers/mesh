# Meshcoin | MESH

Meshcoin is an experimental peer-to-peer cryptocurrency written in [dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language that currently employs [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work#:~:text=Proof%20of%20work%20(PoW)%20is,minimal%20effort%20on%20their%20part.) consensus mechanism (we have plans to form a new and more efficient consensus mechanism). Unlike bitcoin, meshcoin makes use of the much more efficient hashing algorithm [blake2b](https://www.blake2.net/) instead of the compute intensive [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashing algorithm currently being used in bitcoin.
